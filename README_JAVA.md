# SDK initialization and setup

1. Add the JitPack repository to your project level build file

 ```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
         maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
}
```

2. Add the dependency to your app level build file

```groovy
dependencies {
     implementation 'com.github.degpeg-media:degpeg-b2c-sdk-android:release_version'
}
```
Current release_version : <img src="https://jitpack.io/v/degpeg-media/degpeg-b2c-sdk-android.svg"/>


3. Create the Application class and extends Controller class. Also add the application class into the manifest.xml file.

Create the Application class
```Java
class AppController extends Controller {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
    }
}
```

Add the application class into the manifest.xml file
```xml
<application
    android:name=".AppController"
    tools:replace="android:name"
>
  
</application>
```

4. Initialize SDK with success and failure callback
```
 DegpegSDKProvider.INSTANCE.init(
        appId,
        secretKey,
        publisherId,
        providerId,
        userRole,
        true,
        () -> {
            runOnUiThread(() -> {
                Toast.makeText(JavaSampleActivity.this, "Success", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            });
            return null;
        },
        s -> {
            runOnUiThread(() -> {
                Toast.makeText(JavaSampleActivity.this, "Error : "+s, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            });
            return null;
        });
```

* UserRoles  
```
UserRole.PUBLISHER

```
DegpegSDKProvider.INSTANCE.updateUser(
    new User("Dhaval Patel", "6278c4556cb38a7a9c10df6e")
);
```

# Usage

            Toast.makeText(JavaSampleActivity.this, "Error : "+s, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        });
        return null;
    });
```

```
 DegpegSDKProvider.INSTANCE.useAsFragment(
    getSupportFragmentManager(),
    0,
    s -> {
        runOnUiThread(() -> {
            Toast.makeText(JavaSampleActivity.this, "Error : "+s, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        });
        return null;
    });
